# Workflow Extension Scenarios

This repository contains files required to set up Snow workflow extension scenarios.

You can find complete scenario documentation on the [Embotics Support Knowledge Base](https://support.embotics.com/support/home). 

These scenarios demonstrate how to use plug-in workflow steps, which are supported with Commander release 7.0.2 and higher. Plug-in steps can be found in the [Plug-in Workflow Steps repository](https://github.com/Embotics/Plug-in-Workflow-Steps).
